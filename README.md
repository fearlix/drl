# Cars vs Planes Classification Using ResNet50

This project trains a ResNet50 model to classify images of **cars** and **planes** using datasets from Hugging Face.

## Features
- Uses **Hugging Face Datasets** for easy data access.
- **Fine-tunes ResNet50** while freezing early layers.
- **Applies MixUp augmentation** for better generalization.
- **Uploads trained models to Hugging Face** for easy sharing.
